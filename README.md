## plOTme: A little set of scripts for visualising Orbitrap data
A few Python scripts designed to aid in the plotting of MS2 and associated HPLC data obtained on an Orbitrap. After initial data processing in your software of choice (if using the Orbitrap in C/D/017, this will be FreeStyle), export your data in CSV format, load things into the relevant script, and let Python take care of the rest.

### General-purpose scripts

***FLASC:*** <ins>F</ins>u<ins>l</ins>l m<ins>as</ins>s spe<ins>c</ins>trometry plots. Coming soon.

***FLEX:*** <ins>F</ins>u<ins>l</ins>l <ins>ex<ins>tracted ion chromatograms. Coming soon.

### Scripts for studying changing injection volumes

***SINCH:*** <ins>S</ins>tudying <ins>in</ins>jection volumes by <ins>ch</ins>romatogram comparison. Designed for plotting chromatograms on the same set of axes where the independent factor is the injection volume (i.e. runtime is the same across all samples). By default, reads the first 5 CSV files in a user-specified folder and assigns them to 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 μL (can be changed in the script).

***SINTA:*** <ins>S</ins>tudying <ins>in</ins>jection volumes by <ins>ta</ins>ndem mass spectrometry. Coming soon.
